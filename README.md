## Project Description
This project is a web-based Task Management Dashboard that helps users manage their tasks effectively. It includes the following key features:

## Task Listing Page
Display tasks with their title, description, due date, and status (Completed/Not Completed).
Provides a clear overview of all tasks at a glance.
Offers options to edit and delete tasks.
## Task Creation Page
Allows users to create new tasks easily.
The task creation form validates user inputs to ensure no task has an empty title or description.
Due date validation ensures that tasks cannot be created with past due dates.
Redirects to the Task Listing Page after a task is created successfully.
## Task Editing Page
Similar to the task creation page, it allows users to edit existing tasks.
Pre-fills the form with the selected task's details for easy updates.
## Responsive Design
The dashboard is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
The user interface adapts appropriately to different screen sizes.
## UI/UX
I've prioritized user-friendly and intuitive design principles.
I've used component libraries and custom-built components to create a user-friendly interface.
